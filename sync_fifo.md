# First In First Out (FIFO) is a very popular and useful design block for purpose of synchronization and a handshaking mechanism between the modules.

Depth of FIFO: The number of slots or rows in FIFO is called the depth of the FIFO.

Width of FIFO: The number of bits that can be stored in each slot or row is called the width of the FIFO.
